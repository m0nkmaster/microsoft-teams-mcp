          The diff is in pr-diff.txt. Read it and review the changes.
          
          Your task:
          1. Read the diff from pr-diff.txt
          2. Identify any bugs, security issues, performance problems, or code quality improvements
          3. Post your review as a GitHub PR comment using the gh CLI
          
          For each suggestion, use GitHub's suggestion syntax so it can be accepted with one click:
          \`\`\`suggestion
          corrected code here
          \`\`\`
          
          Use the gh CLI to post your review:
          - For a summary comment: gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body 'your review'
          - For inline suggestions: gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --comment --body 'your review'
          
          Be constructive and specific. Focus on meaningful improvements, not style nitpicks.
          If the code looks good, say so briefly.

          The PR diff is in pr-diff.txt if you need context.

          Provide a helpful, constructive response. You might:
          - Answer questions about your previous review
          - Clarify your suggestions  
          - Acknowledge if the commenter makes a good point
          - Provide additional context or alternatives

          If the comment doesn't require a response (e.g., just 'thanks' or 'done'), don't post anything.

          Use: gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body 'your response'
