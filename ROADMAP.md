# Roadmap

## P1

### Improve login/refresh UX
Show visual feedback when authentication succeeds (e.g. "Logged in, closing browser...") so users know what's happening before the browser auto-closes.

## P2

### Find team
Search/discover teams by name (similar to `teams_find_channel` but returns team-level info).

### Add reactions
React to messages with emoji (like, heart, etc.).

## P3

### Calendar integration
Get upcoming meetings from Outlook calendar.

### Find meeting recordings
Locate and retrieve meeting recordings/transcripts.
